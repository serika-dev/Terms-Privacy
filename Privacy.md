Welcome to Serika.dev and Toka! We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy provides a comprehensive explanation of how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal data across Serika.dev and its sub-platform Toka, as well as outlining your rights under applicable data protection laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**1. Data We Collect**

We collect and process the following types of personal information:

- **Account Information**: Username, email address, password (encrypted), avatar, banner, and join date.
- **IP Addresses**: Information related to the IP addresses used during access, including date and time stamps.

- **Developer API Keys**: Information about whether you have created or requested a developer API key.
- **Error Reports**: Automatically generated error reports, which may include technical details about your usage and environment. These are sent to us via a secure webhook and you cannot opt out of this process.

- **Toka Profile Data**: Display name, handle, biography, profile photo, banner image, links (e.g., website), optional location and language, account status (e.g., verified, protected), visibility and content preference settings relevant to Toka.
- **Toka Posts and Interactions**: Posts you create on Toka and related metadata (timestamps, language, hashtags, mentions, links, attached media, polls), replies you make or receive, reposts/quotes you perform, and basic delivery metadata (e.g., the client used, approximate locale, non-precise location if enabled by you).
- **Toka Engagement Data**: Your likes, bookmarks, reposts/quotes, and other engagement signals on Toka, along with associated timestamps.

- **OAuth Authorizations**: Metadata about third-party OAuth clients you authorize (client identifier, scopes granted, creation and revocation timestamps). This does not include your password; access is controlled via OAuth tokens. Third-party applications operate under their own terms and privacy policies.

**Beta Program and Data Usage**

We offer a beta program that allows users to access new features before they are released to the general public. Participation in the beta program is opt-in. All data generated by users in the beta program (except for messages) may be used to improve our services. As of 16/05/2025, while the beta program has existed for some time, beta data has not yet been used to improve our services. **We will never use beta data to train or develop a custom AI LLM.**

**AI Training and Message Data**

By default, we do NOT use your messages for AI training. If you wish, you may opt in to our AI training program, which allows us to use your data, including messages, to train and improve our AI language models (LLMs). Participation in this program is strictly opt-in, and you can change your preference at any time. If you do not opt in, your messages will never be used for AI training. If you do opt in, your data may be used to train and develop AI LLMs.

**2. Legal Bases for Processing Your Data**

Under the GDPR, we process your data on the following legal grounds:

- **Consent**: Where applicable, we process your data based on your explicit consent, for example, when you create an account or subscribe to our services.
- **Contractual Necessity**: Processing is necessary to fulfill our contract with you, such as managing your subscription and providing access to the features of Serika.dev.
- **Legitimate Interests**: We may process your data for legitimate business interests, such as improving our services, ensuring the security of our platform, and protecting against fraud.
- **Legal Obligations**: We may process your data to comply with legal obligations, including financial regulations and law enforcement requests.

**3. How We Use Your Data**

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- To create and manage your user account.

- To improve user services using data from the beta program (except for messages), but never for training or developing custom AI LLMs unless you have opted in to the AI training program.
- To automatically collect and process error reports to maintain and improve the stability and security of our platform.

- To operate Toka’s core features: create, publish, distribute, and display posts, replies, and reposts/quotes; populate feeds and recommendations; maintain social graphs, lists, and related discovery features.

**4. Data Retention**

We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or to comply with legal requirements. Account data is retained while the account is active. Upon account deletion, we may retain certain information for a limited period for legal or regulatory purposes. All retained data will be securely stored and protected to ensure confidentiality.

**5. Sharing Your Data**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties without your consent, except in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers**: We use third-party service providers, such as Stripe for payment processing, who are contractually obligated to protect your data.
- **Legal Compliance**: We may disclose your information when required by law or in response to valid legal requests.
- **Business Transfers**: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred, subject to appropriate safeguards to protect your privacy.

- **Public Toka Content**: Content you choose to make public on Toka (such as public profile fields and public posts) is visible to others, may be reshared by other users, embedded, or indexed by search services. Your visibility settings determine who can see your content. Removing content may not immediately remove copies in caches, backups, or reshares by others.

**6. International Data Transfers**

We are based in the European Economic Area (EEA). If your data is transferred outside the EEA, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information, in accordance with GDPR standards. Such safeguards may include standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or other lawful mechanisms to ensure your data is adequately protected.

**7. Your Rights Under GDPR**

As a data subject under the GDPR, you have the following rights:

- **Right to Access**: You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- **Right to Rectification**: You can ask us to correct any inaccurate or incomplete information.
- **Right to Erasure**: You may request that we delete your personal data, subject to certain legal obligations.
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data.
- **Right to Data Portability**: You can request to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used format.
- **Right to Object**: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for specific purposes.
- **Right to Withdraw Consent**: Where processing is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

**8. Data Security**

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of your personal data. This includes encryption, secure data storage, restricted access to personal data, and regular audits to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities. We also train our staff to follow best practices for data protection and security.

**9. Children's Privacy**

Our services are not intended for individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete that information promptly. We also implement measures to verify the age of users where applicable.

**10. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website and updating the effective date. In cases where significant changes are made, we may provide additional notice through email or other communication channels. Your continued use of our services constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.

**11. Limitation of Liability for U.S. Users**

Please note that our services and operations are based in the European Union, and we are subject to European data protection laws. By using our services, U.S. users acknowledge and agree that any disputes involving data privacy shall be governed by the laws of the Netherlands, and that any legal claims must be brought within the jurisdiction of the Netherlands. We do not consent to the jurisdiction of any U.S. courts in relation to data privacy claims. Additionally, U.S. users agree that any claims related to data protection must be pursued individually and not as part of a class action, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

**12. Liability Disclaimer and Data Accuracy**

We take reasonable measures to ensure that the information we collect and use is accurate, up-to-date, and reliable. However, we cannot guarantee the complete accuracy of all data at all times. Users are responsible for ensuring the information they provide is accurate and for notifying us of any discrepancies. We disclaim liability for any consequences arising from inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete information provided by users.

**13. Serika Browser**

The Serika Browser is a standalone web browser application developed and operated by Schoolsquid. Unlike our online services (Serika.dev and Toka), the Serika Browser operates on a completely different privacy model:

- **Open Source**: The Serika Browser is fully open source. The complete source code is publicly available, allowing anyone to inspect, verify, and audit our privacy claims. This transparency ensures that our commitment to user privacy can be independently verified by the community.
- **No Data Collection**: The Serika Browser does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user information, browsing data, history, or telemetry to our servers or any third parties.
- **No Trackers**: The browser itself contains no tracking mechanisms, analytics, or monitoring tools. Your browsing activity remains completely private and is never shared with us or anyone else.
- **Local-Only Operations**: All browser functionality, including settings, bookmarks, history, and preferences, is stored locally on your device. Nothing is synchronized to the cloud or transmitted externally unless you explicitly choose to use features that require internet connectivity (such as visiting websites).
- **Third-Party Content**: While the Serika Browser itself does not track you, websites you visit may contain their own trackers, cookies, and analytics tools operated by third parties. The Serika Browser includes a built-in ad blocker and tracker blocker that can be enabled to prevent these third-party tracking mechanisms from functioning. When enabled, these privacy features significantly reduce or eliminate third-party tracking on the websites you visit.
- **No Accounts or Authentication**: The Serika Browser does not require account creation, login, or any form of user authentication to function. Your usage of the browser is completely anonymous.

In summary, the Serika Browser is designed with privacy as its foundation. We have no visibility into how you use the browser, what sites you visit, or any other aspect of your browsing activity. The browser operates entirely on your local device, and all data remains under your exclusive control.

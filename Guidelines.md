### **Permitted Applications**

1. **Creative Content Development**
   - Users are encouraged to generate imagery of characters originating from various media, such as television series, video games, literature, and other creative domains. This functionality supports users in extending their artistic engagement with beloved narratives and characters.
   - **Caveat**: In the event of copyright or intellectual property infringement, the individual creator bears sole responsibility for such outputs. Serika.dev merely supplies the technological tools and lacks foresight into specific user-generated outputs. We emphasize the necessity of respecting intellectual property laws and adhering to fair use principles in all creative endeavors.

2. **NSFW Content Creation**
   - The generation of NSFW content is permissible within the confines of legal and ethical norms. It is incumbent upon users to ensure that the content generated refrains from contravening legal statutes, exploiting individuals, or infringing on the rights of others.
   - Compliance with regional laws and the guidelines established by relevant platforms is mandatory. Serika.dev disavows liability for misuse and retains the authority to investigate and address any breaches of these allowances.

3. **Educational and Research-Oriented Usage**
   - Educators, researchers, and artists are invited to utilize these models for advancing educational initiatives, artistic projects, and exploratory experiments. This includes fostering innovative artistic expressions, conducting research on AI applications, and elucidating complex concepts through visual and textual aids.
   - Academic and pedagogical applications must maintain ethical standards, ensuring the generated content aligns with institutional and disciplinary expectations.

4. **Custom Character and Scenario Development**
   - Users may craft original characters, scenarios, and artistic representations for both personal and collaborative purposes, provided these creations respect existing intellectual property frameworks.
   - Collaborative ventures, such as designing characters for shared projects, games, or narratives, are permissible with the consent of all participants, who must jointly adhere to these usage policies.

### **Prohibited Practices**

1. **Representation of Real Individuals**
   - The generation of images or content depicting real individuals, whether public figures (e.g., celebrities or influencers) or private citizens, is expressly prohibited unless explicit, documented consent has been obtained. The protection of privacy and individual rights is paramount in ensuring ethical AI use.

2. **Political Content Generation**
   - The creation of images or content featuring political figures, symbols, campaigns, or ideologically sensitive topics intended to provoke controversy, propagate misinformation, or serve propagandistic purposes is strictly forbidden.
   - Such restrictions are imperative to maintain platform neutrality and mitigate the potential misuse of AI tools in politically charged or divisive contexts.

3. **Content Related to Illicit Activities**
   - The generation or discussion of content linked to illegal substances, activities, or conspiratorial undertakings is categorically banned. This includes, but is not limited to:
     - Depictions or descriptions of criminal activities.
     - Content that contravenes local, national, or international statutes.
   - Noncompliance will result in immediate suspension and may entail legal repercussions.

4. **Exploitative or Harmful Outputs**
   - Content that promotes hate speech, harassment, or discrimination against any individual or group based on attributes such as race, gender, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation is prohibited.
   - Furthermore, material intended to demean, exploit, or harm others is unequivocally unacceptable and subject to strict enforcement actions.

5. **Deceptive or Misinformative Material**
   - The use of AI models to produce misleading content, such as fake news, impersonations, or other forms of deception, is disallowed. This includes the creation of "deepfakes" or any outputs designed to manipulate public perception or erode trust.
   - Such practices undermine societal trust and contravene the ethical principles underpinning AI use.

# Serika.dev Terms of Service

**Last Revised: 12/11/2025**

## 1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form a legally binding agreement between you (“User” or “you”) and Schoolsquid Company (“Schoolsquid,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), the operator of the Serika.dev platform and its sub-platforms, including Toka (“Serika.dev” and “Toka,” collectively the “Platform”). The Platform offers an advanced digital environment enabling users to interact with AI-generated characters and participate in various creative activities (collectively, “the Services”).

By accessing, browsing, or otherwise using the Platform, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, along with our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by us. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately stop using the Platform. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity, in which case “you” shall refer to both you and that entity.

We may update or amend these Terms at any time, with or without prior notice, by posting an updated version on the Platform. Your continued use of the Platform after such changes will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms. We encourage you to review these Terms regularly to stay informed of any updates.

- **Open Source Software**: The Serika Browser is fully open source. The complete source code is publicly available for inspection, review, and audit by anyone. This transparency allows independent verification of our privacy and security claims and enables community contributions to the browser's development.

- **Privacy-First Design**: The Serika Browser is designed with user privacy as a core principle. The browser does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data, browsing history, telemetry, or analytics to Schoolsquid or any third parties. All browsing activity remains entirely local to your device.

- **Local Data Storage**: All browser data, including bookmarks, history, settings, and preferences, is stored exclusively on your local device. No data is synchronized to cloud services or transmitted to external servers operated by Schoolsquid.

- **Third-Party Content and Built-In Protections**: While the Serika Browser itself does not track or collect user data, websites you visit may employ their own tracking technologies, cookies, and analytics tools. The Serika Browser includes built-in ad blocking and tracker blocking features that, when enabled, help prevent third-party websites from tracking your activity. These protections are user-configurable and do not affect the browser's core privacy guarantees.
